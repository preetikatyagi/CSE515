STRIndex.c++

This program builds the STR Tee indexing by using the data file in the following format-

<Image Id 1>,L1,L2,L3,L4,L5
<Image Id 2>,L1,L2,L3,L4,L5

etc..

Execution steps-

1. Save the input file (1.txt) in the same folder as that of executable.
2. Run the program (command line / visual studio).
3. Enter the number of descriptors 
4. Enter the disk page size

Output: Two files - 

1. STRTree.txt - consists of internal index structure
2. STRLeaf.txt - consists of data objects
